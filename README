ComplexIT is a Lexington, MA based computer support company run by a friend.

This is a simple static rails app I put together using 

     script/generate scaffold 

and then removed some of the unnecessary cruft.  I maximized
simplicity of programmer effort not simplicity or compactness or speed
of the resulting code.

every Sunday morning rails class requested I put it online.
